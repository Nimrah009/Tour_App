It is Dijkstra Algorithm (An algorithum for finding shortest path between two nodes in a graph) based travelling application built by using python. 
This program helps tours and travelling companies as a recommender system for
passengers. If we give it our current location (root) it will display answers according to our queries. We have some interesting questions to be asked by
our system.
#### ● Like, if I want a world tour, which route(sequence of cities) will be the best in order to travel to all the cities with least cost and time.
#### ● If there is no direct route between two cities, which would be the cheapest route.
#### ● Largest path (distance) between two cities.
#### ● Smallest path (Displacement) between two cities.
